*** Imp points ** in Regression models 
	-- Y = dependent variable  like Salary or Profit 
	-- X  = independent variable like Experince , company revenue etc 
	-- in regression we are predicting the dependent variable 

  1. Linear Regression model  -> Y = a + bX

  -- via using skLearn library
  		project : Predict the salary based on experince of an employee


  -- via Mathmatically driving Y hat hypothesis

  2. Multiple Linear Regression Model --> Y = a + bX + cX ...... nX
  		Project : Predict the profit based on multiple variables like 

  3. Polynomial regression model --> Y = a + bx + cx^2 + .... nX^n 
  		Project : Position and salaries. --> to predict the previous salary of the candidate.


  4. SVR (Support Vector Regression) Model

  5. Decision Tree Model

  6. Random Forest Model
